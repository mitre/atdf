## Automated Test Decision Framework

Use the Automated Test Decision Framework tool to identify the highest-value components of a legacy codebase for which automated unit tests should initially focus. Use of this tool presumes a legacy codebase that has no, or insufficient, automated test code in its baseline. The Automated Test Decision Framework identifies the components of a legacy software system which most likely maximize Return on Investment (ROI) for resources allocated to introducing automated tests. Optionally, the Automated Test Decision Framework can also provide an estimate of the relative costs associated with introducing automated tests.
