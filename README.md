## Automated Test Decision Framework

Use the Automated Test Decision Framework tool to prioritize components of a legacy codebase when introducing automated tests. This tool presumes a legacy codebase that has no, or insufficient, automated test code in its baseline. The Automated Test Decision Framework 
ranks the components of a legacy software system to maximize Return on Investment (ROI) when adding automated tests. Optionally, the Automated Test Decision Framework can also estimate the relative cost across components for introducing automated tests.

ATDF was independently verified by a team of researchers at George Mason University. The results were presented and published at the [IEEE International Conference on Software Testing (ICST)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8728916 "IEEE ATDF Paper").
